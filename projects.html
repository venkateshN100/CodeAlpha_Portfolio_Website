			<p align="center">During my internship at TCS iON, I accomplished the project "Automate Sentiment Analysis of Textual Comments and Feedback." Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights into the field of natural language processing and machine learning. By developing an automated system to analyze sentiments in textual comments and feedback, I discovered the power of AI-driven solutions in understanding and processing vast amounts of unstructured data. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also fostered a deeper understanding of the importance of harnessing technology to derive meaningful insights from user feedback. Overall, my internship at TCS Ion was a rewarding journey that equipped me with practical knowledge and prepared me for future challenges in the domain of artificial intelligence.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/Venkatesh-Nagaraj/Sentiment-Analyisis-of-textual-Comment-and-feedback.git" target="_blank" class="button">GitHub Repo</a></p>
